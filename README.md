This repository demonstrates a common error in Elixir: stack overflow errors caused by non-tail-recursive functions.  The `bug.exs` file contains a function that recursively reverses a string without tail recursion optimization.  The `bugSolution.exs` file provides a corrected version that uses tail recursion, preventing stack overflow errors for large inputs.  Tail recursion is essential for handling large data sets in Elixir without exceeding the stack limit.
